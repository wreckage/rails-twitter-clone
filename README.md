Rails Twitter Clone

A twitter clone created using Ruby on Rails and following the steps
outlined in the 
[Ruby on Rails Tutorial] (https://www.railstutorial.org/book/sign_up#sec-exercises_rails_environments)
by Michael Hartl,

I added in tests that use rspec, capaybara, and factory_girl. Simplecov is also included
for test coverage. All of the original tests (the ones that use minitest) are still present.

I rewrote some of the views to make use of the Slim templating framework. All of the old views
can be found in app/old_views
