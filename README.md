#Rails Twitter Clone

A twitter clone created using Ruby on Rails and following the steps
outlined in the 
[Ruby on Rails Tutorial] (https://www.railstutorial.org/book/sign_up#sec-exercises_rails_environments)
by Michael Hartl,

##Tests
Tests are implemented three different ways:
- Minitest
- Rspec, capybara, factory_girl
- Cucumber, capybara
There is considerable test overlap, and this is intentional.

##Slim
I rewrote some of the views to make use of the Slim templating framework. All of the old views
can be found in app/old_views.
